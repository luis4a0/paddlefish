# TODO

## Fonts

Adding support for TrueType fonts is a must.

## Page objects

Make page objects available to multiple documents. Currently, adding a page
to a document makes the page exclusive to that document.

## Building

Use CMake for building, in order to compile in many architectures (at
least, GNU/Linux, MacOS, Windows).

## Testing, continuous integration

Use Travis or GitHub actions and add tests.
